Amazing!.\n","I had emailed ahead and we had got the same room as before (room 21) which is at the lower part of the resort, the advantages are that it is very quiet and you get the wildlife (oryx and gazelles drinking from your pool) We arrived very early in the morning and the receptionist welcomed us back when we got to the room the hotel had left us a bottle of champagne on ice  which was nice.\n","Our room had wifi internet access and a docking station  sound system for the iPod The staff were very friendly and very efficient  a number wondered if they were employed when we last visited, if they saw a book you automatically found a bookmark.\n","We loved eating outside the restaurant soaking up the atmosphere with flaming torches casting light in the darkness of the desert under twinkling stars and the candles on our table eating our way through the most amazing choice of courses with a bottle of wine.\n","Not huge ourdoorsy types and we go to get away from it all, have great service, great accommodation without to fight our way through Dubai International.From start to finish your stay will be of pure luxury.\n","The room with swimming pool was the best we had stayed in..
