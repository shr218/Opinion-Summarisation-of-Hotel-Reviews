# Opinion-Summarisation-of-Hotel-Reviews
## Project Overview:
Opinion summarisation using aspect-based sentiment analysis is a powerful technique for automatically extracting the most relevant and informative aspects of a product or service from text documents such as customer reviews, social media posts, and news articles. This paper uses topic modelling to identify the different aspects of the hotel that customers have expressed in their reviews. A summarisation technique was then used to extract the most representative sentences or phrases for each aspect. Subsequently, sentiment analysis was used to determine the sentiment expressed for each aspect, such as positive, negative and neutral. From the reviews associated with a particular aspect and corresponding to the sentiment, the most relevant opinion phrases are extracted.
